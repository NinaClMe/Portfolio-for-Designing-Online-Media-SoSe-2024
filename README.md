The kaleidoscope project uses several key algorithms to create an interactive and visually engaging experience. The shape addition algorithm adds shapes to the canvas with random sizes, positions, rotations, and colors, storing these attributes in an array and redrawing the canvas to include the new shape. The shape drawing algorithm then renders all stored shapes onto the canvas by clearing it, filling the background, and iterating through the shapes array to draw each shape with its specific attributes. The background color change algorithm randomly changes the canvas background color and redraws the shapes to reflect this new background. The mirroring algorithm creates symmetrical effects by splitting the canvas into sections and mirroring each section horizontally and/or vertically. Finally, the save canvas algorithm allows users to save the current state of the canvas as an image by converting the canvas content to a data URL and triggering a download. These algorithms work together seamlessly to offer a dynamic and creative kaleidoscope tool.

We used JavaScript to implement the algorithms, alongside HTML and CSS to visualize and enhance the code.

The final result is a playful user interface that allows users to place different shapes in random colors at random positions. Ultimately, the image is mirrored along multiple axes to create a visually appealing kaleidoscope effect.

This project is a group project by Amy Grindau, Nina Menzl and Louis Zimmermann.
